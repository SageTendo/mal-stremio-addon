            Access and manage your MyAnimeList (MAL) anime lists directly in Stremio. Easily track your watched anime,
            plan to watch, and sync progress with MAL automatically.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>View and manage your MAL anime lists</li>
            <li>Filter anime by genre</li>
            <li>Sync progress (Watching, Completed, On Hold) with MAL</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <h2>How Syncing Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching from "Plan to Watch" → Moves to "Watching"</li>
            <li>Movies from "Plan to Watch" → Moves to "Completed"</li>
            <li>Watching from "Watching" → Watched; last episode marks "Completed"</li>
            <li>Watching from "On Hold" → Moves to "Watching"</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Since Stremio lacks built-in tracking, the addon marks progress when subtitles are
            requested, not when the episode is fully watched.
